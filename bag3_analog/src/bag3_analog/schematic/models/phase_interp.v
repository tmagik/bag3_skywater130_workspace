    // The phase interpolator behavioral model behaves as follows:
    //
    // Normal (expected) operation:
    //     1. Wait for a_in or b_in to toggle. Register the one that toggled as early
    //     2. Wait for the other signal to toggle. Register this one as late.
    //        Under normal operations, it'll be the same direction as the early (e.g., a rise b rise).
    //     3. Measure the delay between the two inputs.
    //     4. Based on the en/enb settings for the two signals and the relative delay steps,
    //        calculate the relative delay (i.e., as a proportion to the delay between the two inputs).
    //     5. Calculate the absolute delay, accounting for the intrinsic delay as well.
    //     6. Propagate the inputs to the output with the absolute delay.
    //
    // This step-by-step operation is enabled by the FSM, which has the following states:
    //     IDLE        : Waiting for an early edge.
    //     A_EARLY_RISE: Waiting for late edge given that early edge was rising a_in.
    //                   Under normal operation, late edge then should be rising b_in.
    //     A_EARLY_FALL: Waiting for late edge given that early edge was falling a_in.
    //                   Under normal operation, late edge then should be falling b_in.
    //     B_EARLY_RISE: Waiting for late edge given that early edge was rising b_in.
    //                   Under normal operation, late edge then should be rising a_in.
    //     B_EARLY_FALL: Waiting for late edge given that early edge was falling b_in.
    //                   Under normal operation, late edge then should be falling a_in.
    //
    // The delay calculation and delayed assignment to output happens when the late signal is registered,
    // which happens at the state transition from A/B_EARLY_RISE/FALL to IDLE.
    //
    // Edge cases:
    //     If any of the inputs and enable signals is x, then output is x immediately.
    //
    //     If a_en and a_enb are not complementary, then error. Same for b_en and b_enb. Same for a_en and b_en.
    //
    //     If the intrinsic delay less than the calculated delay (which is a linear function of the
    //      delay between the 2 inputs) such that the delay from the late input to the output is negative,
    //      then error and don't update the output.
    //      Note: this isn't an actual "problem" in the actual circuit, but the model works by
    //      applying a delay relative to the late edge. Hence it won't work in this case.
    //
    //     If the early edge is rising and the late edge is falling (or vice versa), then error.
    //      However, treat the late falling edge as the early falling edge and update the state correspondingly.
    //      In other words, assume the early edge was invalid (or that it was actually a late edge and the
    //      previous rising edge was not captured).
    //
    //     If one input toggles (and is detected as the early edge) and the same input toggles again
    //      without the other input toggling, then error. However, treat the latter toggle as the early
    //      edge, update the state correspondingly, and proceed. In other words, assume the former edge was invalid.
    //
    //     When an input is x, output x immediately as described above. In addition, do not update the state.
    //      Note that this means that the FSM can see two consecutive (defined) toggles from the same input
    //      in the same direction. For example, a_in can be 0 -> 1 -> x -> 1. In this case, as was with
    //      the above cases, error but treat the latter rising edge (x -> 1) as the early rising edge.
    //      In other words, assume that the former rising edge (0 -> 1) was invalid.
    //
    //     If both inputs change simultaneously, the model interprets them given the current state:
    //      IDLE        : If both signals rise or fall, then arbitrarily assign one as early and the other as late.
    //                      Proceed to delay calculation. Keep state at IDLE.
    //                    If one rises and the other falls, error and keep state at IDLE.
    //                    If one rises or falls and the other becomes x, ignore the latter and register the
    //                      former as the early edge.
    //                    If both become x, error, ignore both, and keep the state at IDLE.
    //      A_EARLY_RISE: If a_in falls and b_in rises, associate rising b_in with the previously detected
    //                      a_in and register it as the late edge. Proceed to delay calculation accordingly.
    //                      Register the falling a_in as the early edge for the next pair of edges and thus
    //                      advance to A_EARLY_FALL.
    //                    If both rise, ignore the previously detected early edge and use the recent rising edges.
    //                      Arbitrarily assign one as early and the other as late. Proceed to delay calculation.
    //                      Advance to IDLE. Note that this only happens when a_in was 1 -> x before and
    //                      both a_in and b_in transition to 1.
    //                    If both fall, error because rising b_in was expected. Ignore the previously detected
    //                      early edge and use the recent falling edges. Arbitrarily assign one as early
    //                      and the other as late. Proceed to delay calculation. Advance to IDLE.
    //                    If a_in rises and b_in falls, error and advance to IDLE. Note that this only
    //                      happens when a_in was 1 -> x before. and a_in transitions to 1, while b_in falls.
    //                    If either a_in or b_in becomes x, ignore the x and treat it as a single edge toggling.
    //                    If both become x, error and keep state at A_EARLY_RISE.
    //     All the other states are mirrored cases of A_EARLY_RISE.
